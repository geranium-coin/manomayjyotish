<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="Career">Career</h2>



<p><strong>From the career point of view, the month of August 2022 is likely to remain average for Aries. During this period, Saturn, the ruling lord of your tenth house, will stay in your tenth in a retrograde position after transiting from the eleventh house, due to which, you can be seen working hard for the success of your work. In the first half of the month, the work which has gone astray can come back because of the presence of Venus and Sun in your fourth house.</strong></p>



<p><strong> Owing to these two planets, new opportunities for employment will knock at your door. During this time, those natives who are looking for a job are likely to meet success. On the other hand, the period may prove to be approved for those who are associated or employed with foreign companies or those related to overseas business. </strong></p>



<p><strong>There is an excellent possibility that you may be fully rewarded for your labour. In the second half of the month, Sun will transit and form a conjunction with Mercury, leading to the formation of Budhaditya Yoga. During this time, there is a strong possibility of opening new employment opportunities for you.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="Finance">Finance</h2>

In such a situation, take out some time for yourself so that you can have some physical rest, otherwise, you may fall ill.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am Pro.Mrs. Sneha Mane warmly welcomes all the astrologers and people. | <span style="color: var(--ast-global-color-3); font-size: 1rem; background-color: var(--ast-global-color-5);">Aquarius Zodiac </span>| Planets travel continuously. They enter from one zodiac sign to another through transits. They have good or bad effect on human life. We are constantly analyzing these zodiac changes of the planets. Accordingly, all the planets are changing their zodiac signs in the coming April. In this, the change of zodiac sign of Guru Maharaj, who is called a natural benefic planet, will be auspicious for all the zodiac signs in many ways. Because they are entering your voice. Guru Maharaj&#8217;s zodiac will change on 13th April and we are analyzing their effects according to the zodiac. In today&#8217;s episode how can we change this sign of Guru Maharaj to Aquarius? We will discuss this in detail. | Aquarius Zodiac |</strong></p>
<p><strong>To understand this better, we have to first understand the information about Jupiter and its causation. Of all the planets, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are known as the four natural benefic planets. However, the condition applies to the moon that the moon near the full moon is considered auspicious and the moon near the new moon is considered inauspicious. The farther the Moon is from the Sun, the further away it is from the houses. Apart from this, many conditions apply to the Moon from the point of view of auspiciousness. Mercury is also a natural benefic planet. However, the direction of its influence changes according to the planet with which it occurs. So somewhere there is a lack of his natural goodness. Then Jupiter and Venus are the only two auspicious planets left. Venus usually changes its zodiac within a month. That is, he gives all the good and bad results in a month. That is, the presence of Venus gives auspiciousness for small incidents. But Guru Maharaj stays in one zodiac for about 13 months. #astroguru   #astroguruma #guruparivartan | Aquarius Zodiac |</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also their vision has a lot to do with it. For all the other auspicious planets, the seventh is the only aspect. </strong>But Guru Maharaj has a total of three darshans named Pancham, Seventh and Navam.<strong> The important thing is that being a natural benefic planet, their vision is more important than the location. Actually their eyes are considered like nectar. In other words, Guru Maharaj has the power to stay in the zodiac for 13 months and also gives auspicious places to four places in the magazine. According to the cause and effect of the four places, very auspicious results are given to the natives. That is why the change in the form of Guru Maharaj or his zodiac sign is very important. Now this is going to be especially important. Because they are about to embark on a pleasant journey, a journey that has been negative for the past three years. In our language, Guru Maharaj has been walking on rocky roads for the last three years. Even though he himself is on a rocky path, he has given as many auspicious results as he can. However, since his visit was in a state of conflict, it naturally affected the general public. After entering his Pisces sign, he will now begin his journey on a good four-lane road. As a result, everyone will get their very auspicious results. In this way, Guru Maharaj is entering Pisces from Aquarius on 13th April. What will be the effect of this zodiac sign on Aquarius? Let us understand it now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you see from the point of view of Aquarius, then Guru Maharaj will come to your second place. Actually Guru Maharaj is not the planet of your zodiac. However Guru Maharaja&#8217;s position, his zodiac change is always very important for you. Because they are your Dhanesh and Benefesh. He is the lord of the second and eleventh house in Aquarius. The second place in the magazine is considered the place of wealth, the voice of the family. Therefore, we consider the eleventh house as the place of profit and fulfillment of desires. Considering the causality of these two places, very important things come under the jurisdiction of Guru Maharaj. Now they are going to enter your second place in their Pisces. Due to which this situation will be created in Dhanesh wealth. Which is considered very auspicious. You will get very auspicious results during this period. Your speech will attain enlightenment and spiritual level. When you create a topic, your study, your knowledge will show through that structure. People who are Aquarius born writers will be able to delve into their writing. Wisdom will be reflected in the voice of the speakers. | Aquarius Zodiac |</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall, Guru Maharaja entering the second place will benefit you in many ways. More importantly, Guru Maharaja in second place will be able to complete the economic triangle in the magazine alone. Because Dhanasthan is one of the places of the triangle and Guru Maharaj who comes in any position of the triangle alone has the ability to complete the triangle. Also, since this is your Dhanesh and benesh, you will get a lot of benefits from this triangle. The magazine covers various yogas. Economic triangle is a very important and beneficial yoga. This yoga is formed by the sum of the third, sixth and tenth yogas. Now that Guru Maharaja will enter your second position, his vision will move to the sixth and tenth position. So this economic triangle is going to end here. This triangle is considered very important for monetization. Because earning money is the basic need of the world. One cannot deny that most other problems are easily solved with adequate income. Earning money is very important especially in today&#8217;s modern world. which you are going to get. #astroguru #guruparivartan</strong></p>
<p><strong> Another important factor is that your family may develop during this time. It can also be called auspicious effect. Of course, this increase can happen in different ways. A new child may be born in the family. Marriage of boy or girl. This method can also lead to the development of the family. In short, in the second place, Guru Maharaj will give you auspicious results and benefits along with earning money. You have to be more discriminatory in the support you provide to other people.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is said that when good times begin, good things happen to us in many ways. The arrival of Guru Maharaj in the second place can be said to be the beginning of good times for you. Because Guru Maharaj is not going to give you money alone. Apart from this, they will be good for you in many other ways. He has a total of three ideas, the fifth, the seventh and the ninth. Their vision is more important than their position. Because his vision is called nectar vision. Accordingly, the fifth sight of Guru Maharaj will fall on your sixth position in the second place. From the sixth position in the magazine we look at health, job, debt, competitors, enemies. The result of Guru Maharaj&#8217;s auspicious vision at this place is stability in the job, creating opportunities for advancement, bringing forth one&#8217;s work in the field, changing the direction of work. Along with this, the right castes will also get promotion opportunities. Those who need loan can get it easily. Your opponents will not be able to do much harm to you. They will be more engaged in their work. Because the Cancer of the Moon comes in your sixth house. Jupiter and Moon are friendly planets. So from this point of view you will get more auspicious results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After this, the seventh sight of Guru Maharaj will fall on your eighth place. Aquarius is a very intelligent creature. According to this, the effect of this vision is that if you are doing some intellectual work, doing research, if you are doing a deep study of a subject, then the chances of success in that work will increase greatly. Along with this, the possibility of family benefits and sudden gains will increase. Where you have already invested, there will be opportunities to make gains. Although the eighth position is considered negative in a nutshell, but by the grace of Guru Maharaj, you will get very auspicious results from this position as well. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After this the ninth sight of Guru Maharaj will fall on your tenth place. The tenth place in the magazine is called Karma Sthana. The sign of Mars in Scorpio appears here in Aquarius. Mars and Jupiter are friendly planets. Therefore, there will be special success in the treatment between Dhanesh and Dashmesh. The special thing is that whenever Mars comes in Pisces, Cancer, Scorpio, you will get a chance to make sudden profit this year. Because the tenth is your Karmesh. Guru Maharaj&#8217;s auspicious sight is falling on him in the tenth house and Mars clearly changes the zodiac in one and a half months. So Guru Maharaja stays in one zodiac for thirteen months. Therefore, whenever Mars comes in the sight of Guru Maharaj, you will get special benefits. More importantly, the direction of these benefits will be primarily financial. In short, Guru Maharaja, who comes in the place of wealth, is going to give you complete wealth. You should make full use of it. |  Kumbh Rashi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Talking about the remedies, astrology tells many small measures which anyone can do easily. There is no need to do anything special for this. Furthermore, even if the solution is small, the effect is huge. The only condition is that they should be corrected with full faith. According to this, keeping in mind the measures of Aquarius, the people of Aquarius should be given food in old age homes. Because Guru Maharaja is about to enter your second place. There, they will be in your voice. According to this, you should donate food to the old age home. This remedy will be very beneficial for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, I think this information is sufficient to understand the effect of Jupiter change on Aquarius. So let&#8217;s stop here in today&#8217;s episode. In the next section, we will study the effects on the next zodiac sign. So let&#8217;s see you again in the next part. #astroguru #astroguruma #guruparivartan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Good luck! </strong></p>

<h1><strong>Guru change &#8211; Virgo Rasa &#8211; Daily Horoscope </strong></h1>
<p><strong>wish fulfillment with profit</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am Mrs.Sneha Mane warmly welcomes all the astrologers and People. Planets travel continuously. They enter from one zodiac sign to another through transits. They have good or bad effect on human life. We are constantly analyzing these zodiac changes of the planets. Accordingly, all the planets are changing their zodiac signs in the coming April. In this, the change of zodiac sign of Guru Maharaj, who is called a natural benefic planet, will be auspicious for all the zodiac signs in many ways. Because they are entering your voice. Guru Maharaj&#8217;s zodiac will change on 13th April and we are analyzing their effects according to the zodiac. In today&#8217;s episode how can we change this Guru Maharaj&#8217;s zodiac sign for Virgo? We will discuss this in detail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To understand this better, we have to first understand the information about Jupiter and its causation. Jupiter is the natural benefic planet or the most auspicious of all the planets. Therefore the success or failure of that caste or the life of that caste is determined by the position of the guru in the magazine. Another very important thing is that Guru Maharaj has the power to make four out of twelve places auspicious in the magazine. Because along with their position, their three visions also have a lot of influence. In fact, their vision is called nectar vision. Guru Maharaja is responsible for the end of life, education, marriage, redemption with children, which we can call death or salvation. The creation in the activities of such Guru Maharaja has decreased in the last three-four years. His journey started in a sad way. #astroguru  #astroguruma #guruparivartan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Of course, Ketu was also sitting with him when he first entered his Sagittarius sign. As a result, there was a meeting of Guru-Ketu. Actually, there was a planetary war between the two. In which Guru Maharaj was defeated. As a result, Guru Maharaj could not give his auspicious results in every way despite being in tune. Then Guru Maharaj entered Capricorn. Capricorn is their lowest form. After this he entered Aquarius at a very high speed. After that he again came in Capricorn and became debilitated. He again entered Aquarius. Even in the current situation, their journey has started from Aquarius. On 13th April 2022, he will again change his zodiac and enter Pisces. All the zodiac signs will get very auspicious results of their zodiac change. Of course some zodiac signs will get less and some zodiac signs will get more. But you will get good results, that&#8217;s for sure! Because Guru Maharaj is one of the most important natural benefic planets. Also, they stay in the same zodiac for a long time. Hence their influence has been brought to the fore by light. In this way, Guru Maharaj is entering Pisces from Aquarius on 13th April. What will be the effect of this zodiac sign on Virgo? Let us understand it now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you think of Kanya Raas or marriage, Guru Maharaja is the fourth and seventh house of your magazine. That is, he occupies two very important positions in the magazine, the fourth and the seventh. Therefore, even though Guru Maharaja may not be the karaka of your zodiac sign, his position, his appearance is very important to you. Now these zodiac signs are going to change and enter your seventh place. There he would form Hansa Yoga, one of the Panchmahapurush Yogas. Which is considered a very auspicious and important Raja Yoga. Therefore, virgins will get its extremely auspicious results. As you know, the seventh place in the magazine is considered to be the place of a married couple. Therefore, according to the factors of the place, your married life will be prosperous during this period. You will have proper communication with your spouse. We also see business from this location. Accordingly, your business will increase during this period. Your business will get a new direction. Which will pave the way for your progress.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Another important point is that Guru Maharaja, who enters the seventh place, will travel to three other important places at the same time through his vision. On the other hand, being the fourth lord, you will also get the auspicious results of that place. We all know that Guru Maharaj has a total of three darshans namely Pancham, Seventh and Navam. Their influence is also huge. In fact, their vision is more important than their condition. Because the vision of Guru Maharaj is called Amrit Drishti. Accordingly, Guru Maharaja&#8217;s fifth vision will fall from the seventh position to your eleventh position. The eleventh place in the magazine is known as the place of profit and fulfillment of desires. With the auspicious sight of Guru Maharaj at this place, all your wishes will be fulfilled suddenly. This will be the time for the fulfillment of all those secret desires that you have in your mind in the past. Along with this, you will also get the opportunity to take advantage of many ways. Castes will also benefit from this where they have invested earlier. In short, it will be a time of great profit and fulfillment of desires. You have to be more discriminatory in the support you provide to other people. More efforts should be made in this regard. So that this beneficial time can be put to good use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After this, the seventh sight of Guru Maharaj will first fall on your zodiac sign. The caste has its own place in the first place in the magazine. From this point of view the personality is understood. Your personality will be enriched by the nectar of Guru Maharaj falling at this place. There will be many big and radical positive changes in your personality. The direction of your thoughts will be right. In fact, your thoughts or your personality as a whole will be much stronger. You have the art of presenting your subject, your point in the right way. That&#8217;s what you always do. But from the point of view of Guru Maharaj, their knowledge will increase. That is to say, a proper, careful layout will be done by you. As the knowledge increases, so does the chances of success for the learners. There will be a lot of progress in education, study, knowledge. In fact, if you say that all the sattvik qualities of Guru Maharaja will come to you, it doesn&#8217;t matter. You have to be more discriminatory in the support you provide to other people. #astroguru #astroguruma #guruparivartan</strong></p>
<p><strong>After this, the ninth sight of Guru Maharaj will fall on your third place. The third place in the magazine is known as the place of strength and diligence. Due to the auspicious sight of Guru Maharaj at this place, the direction of your labor will be right. Doing the right thing for the right reason and getting success out of it can be said to be your specialty in this age. In short, by the grace of Guru Maharaj, the direction of your hard work, your actions will be correct during this period. This will give you the right result. At the same time, brotherhood and small and big journeys are also seen from the third place. Accordingly, your brotherhood will increase. You are going to travel big and small. The special thing is that these trips will also be beneficial for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall, Guru Maharaja is the owner of two very important places in your magazine, the fourth and the seventh. Because of this both these places are going to be auspicious. Also, he will have auspicious sight in three places i.e. profit place, first place and third place. A total of five such places in your magazine will be auspicious at the same time. You will also get very auspicious results according to the reasons for those five places. For about thirteen months, Guru Maharaj will remain in Pisces, that is, you will be in the seventh position. That is, you will continue to get these auspicious results for thirteen months. Therefore, this visible girl child of Guru Maharaj will be very important for the caste.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, on April 29, Shani Maharaj will also change his zodiac sign and enter your sixth place. They are the fifth lord and sixth lord of your zodiac. Therefore, your zodiac sign will also get very auspicious results. Actually, in this April, all the planets will change the zodiac. This is going to be a very big historical event in the world of astrology. The special thing is that most of the planets are going to be very auspicious for Virgo. So surely this time will be very important and beneficial for you. In fact, the results will remain the same throughout the year. Various opportunities for progress and advancement will arise for you. You too will be able to take advantage of this. In fact, you should take it. Because when the time is auspicious, our efforts should be increased in the real sense. Because the success rate is definitely higher.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guru Maharaja will help you in achieving this. Although one of the auspicious Raja Yogas is being created by him in your magazine, one thing you should keep in mind here. That is, Jupiter is not a karaka planet for Virgo. As a result, centralized loopholes are arising here as well. Nevertheless, Guru Maharaj is known as the natural benefic planet or the most auspicious of all the planets. Therefore, even if defects arise, auspicious results are obtained from them. You have to be more discriminatory in the support you provide to other people. Guru Maharaj will surely give you its auspicious results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Talking about the remedies, astrology tells many small measures which anyone can do easily. There is no need to do anything special for this. Furthermore, even if the solution is small, the effect is huge. The only condition is that they should be corrected with full faith. According to this, as mentioned earlier, considering the remedies for Virgo, Guru Maharaj is going to form Hans Yoga in the week of Virgo. Which is going to be very beneficial for you. During this, girls should serve the cow. Cow should be circumcised. Add green fodder. This remedy will be very beneficial for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, I think this information is sufficient to understand the effect of Jupiter change on Virgo. So let&#8217;s stop here in today&#8217;s episode. In the next section, we will study the effects on the next zodiac sign. So let&#8217;s see you again in the next part. #astroguru  #astroguruma #guruparivartan</strong></p>

<p><strong>To understand this better, we have to first understand the information about Jupiter and its causation. Of all the planets, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are the four natural benefic planets. However, the condition applies to the moon that the moon near the full moon is considered auspicious and the moon near the new moon is considered inauspicious. The farther the Moon is from the Sun, the further away it is from the houses. Apart from this, many conditions apply to the Moon from the point of view of auspiciousness. Mercury is also a natural benefic planet. However, the direction of its influence changes according to the planet with which it occurs. So somewhere there is a lack of his natural goodness. Then Jupiter and Venus are the only two auspicious planets left. Venus usually changes its zodiac within a month. That is, he gives all the good and bad results in a month. That is, the presence of Venus gives auspiciousness for small incidents. But Guru Maharaj stays in one zodiac for about 13 months. #Rashifal Rashifal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also their vision has a lot to do with it. For all the other auspicious planets, the seventh is the only aspect. But Guru Maharaj has a total of three darshans named Pancham, Seventh and Navam. The important thing is that being a natural benefic planet, their vision is more important than the location. Actually their eyes are considered like nectar. In other words, Guru Maharaj has the power to stay in the zodiac for 13 months and also keep four places in the magazine in an auspicious way. According to the cause and effect of those four places, very auspicious results are given to the natives. That is why the change in the form of Guru Maharaj or his zodiac sign is very important. Now this is going to be especially important. Because since last three years of continuous negative, struggling journey, now they are going to start a pleasant journey. In our language, Guru Maharaj has been walking on rocky roads for the last three years. Even though he himself is on a rocky path, he has given as many auspicious results as he can. However, since his journey was in a state of conflict, it naturally affected the general public. Having entered their own Pisces, they will now begin their journey on a fine four-lane road. As a result, everyone will get their very auspicious results. In this way, Guru Maharaj is entering Pisces from Aquarius on 13th April. What will be the effect of this zodiac change on Gemini? Let us understand it now.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When you think of Gemini, Guru Maharaj is the seventh lord and tenth lord of your zodiac. In other words, Guru Maharaja is the lord of Mithun or the two most important centers of marriage, the seventh and the tenth. That&#8217;s why Guru Maharaj is a very important planet for you and hence his zodiac sign is very important for you. For the past few months this has been your fate. Now these zodiac signs are going to change and enter your tenth place. In fact, Jupiter is not the significator of Gemini. Because he is the master of the two center places, he is to blame. Even so, owning one is still out of reach for the average person. Especially Guru Maharaja gets the responsibility of marital happiness, matrimonial partner, business, karma. In this way, Guru Maharaj will now enter your tenth place by changing the zodiac. Pisces is their source of water. Their position can be said to be very auspicious for Gemini natives.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The most important feature of Guru Maharaja in the tenth place is that there he will form Hansa Yoga which is one of the Panch Mahapurush Yoga. The most important thing is that this Raja Yoga is going to be formed at your place of Karma. When we think about the Kendra position, according to astrological laws, the fourth position is stronger than the first position. The seventh is considered to be the strongest position and the tenth is considered to be the strongest centre. One of the most auspicious planets in such a powerful center, Guru Maharaja and the Panchmahapurush Yoga created by him, Raja Yoga is one of the most important. Now Guru Maharaj will stay at your place of work for about thirteen months. This whole period will be very useful for starting your business, business security, business development, new business. This New Year will be especially beneficial for the people of Gemini zodiac who work in the field of education, writers and poets, those working in the field of management, new work in the field of education, studying in the field of education. .

<p><strong>&nbsp;Guru Maharaj entering your tenth position will make your tenth position auspicious. At the same time, their vision will have a very good effect on you. We all know that Guru Maharaja has a total of three darshans namely Pancham, Seventh and Navam. The special thing is that their ideas are given more importance than places. Because their vision is considered to be nectar. Accordingly, the fifth vision of Guru Maharaj will fall in your second position in the tenth position. Then the seventh vision will come to the fourth position and the ninth vision will come to the sixth position. The second place in the magazine is called the place of wealth, family and speech. When Guru Maharaj&#8217;s nectar falls at this place, knowledge will flow through your speech. Which means it&#8217;s also going to be the most confusing time of the year. There will be money too. Because the second place is also the place of wealth. There are many ways in which you can earn money. Wealth will be created through karma, especially from your business. There will also be family happiness of the partner.</strong></p>



<p><strong>After this, the seventh sight of Guru Maharaj will fall on your fourth place. The fourth place in the magazine is called the place of happiness. From this various things like Vastu, Vehicle, Land, Happiness, Motherhood are seen. With the auspicious sight of Guru Maharaj at this place, there will be further increase in happiness, peace and prosperity in your home. Apart from this, very auspicious Vastu Yoga, Vehicle Yoga will also be formed for you. Therefore, the people of Gemini who have been dreaming of Vastu or Vehicle for many days, their dream will come true during this period. Those things will also be beneficial for you. Because that auspicious Yoga Guru Maharaj is going to create for you. The important thing is that during this time your Bhagya Shani Maharaj will also enter your destiny. A planet like Rahu will be in your benefic position and Guru Maharaj will be in your tenth position. Gemini sign people will get a lot of support from these three. Therefore, after the coming April month, Gemini native will make great progress in many areas, on many fronts. Of course, progress alone is not enough. If there is no happiness, prosperity, unity, love in your house, then money is useless. But during this time happiness, peace and love will be created in your house. There will be family happiness and wealth.</strong></p>



<p><strong>After this, the ninth sight of Guru Maharaj will fall on your sixth place. Health, job, debt, competitors, enemies are seen from the sixth position in the magazine. The result of having auspicious sight of Guru Maharaj at this place is that your enemies will automatically retreat or they will not have much enthusiasm in opposing you. Those who need loan can get it easily. It can also be beneficial for you. That is, it will be used for the same purpose for which you have taken it. The most important thing is that you will get good health during this period.</strong></p>



<p><strong>In short, Guru Maharaja, the creator of Hansa Yoga, will give you auspicious results in all directions. Enjoy it to the fullest. Actually, from now on there are going to be big changes in your life which are very positive, auspicious and beneficial. You should make full use of it. Live life to the fullest. Earn money the right way. Take proper care of your family and live a good life.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Talking about the remedies, astrology tells many small measures which can be easily done by anyone. There is no need to do anything special for this. Furthermore, even if the solution is small, the effect is huge. The only condition is that they should be dealt with with full confidence. According to this, considering the measures of Gemini, as it has been told earlier that Guru Maharaj is going to create Hans Yoga from the tenth position in your magazine. Therefore, the people of Gemini zodiac should help a young man in his business. Then you can guide him or help him. In short, he should cooperate for the prosperity of his business without any intention. Which will benefit you too.</strong></p>

<p><strong>प्रेमाची कथाप्रेम ही एक निसर्गाने दिलेली देणगी आहे. समाजामध्ये सर्व लोकांमध्ये आपापला मध्ये स्नेह, प्रेम, जिव्हाळा, सहकार्य असले की व्यक्ती मधील प्रेम टिकून राहते. नुकत्याच वयात आलेल्या तरुण-तरुणी मधील आवडता विषय म्हणजे प्रेम.उर्मिला तिच्या बाबतीत हे घडत होते. तीही कोणाच्यातरी प्रेमात पडली होती. मयूर हे तिच्यावर प्रेम करीत होता. हे प्रेम भावना दोघांच्या मनात खेळत होती. परंतु याबाबतीत कोणालाच काहीच माहीत नव्हते.तसे बघायला गेले तर उर्मिलालाचे नुकतेच आईचे छत्र हरवले होते. त्यामुळे ती तिच्या मावशीकडे आली होती. मावशीच्या गावातील कॉलेजच्या तिसऱ्या वर्षाला  शिक्षण घेत होती. गेली दोन वर्षे ती प्रेमात बुडालेली होती. आता तिच्या लग्नाची जबाबदारी तिच्या मावशीकडे होती. ती तिच्या लग्नाचा विचार करत होती. ती तिच्यासाठी गावोगावी स्थळे पाहत होती.उर्मिला तिच्या प्रेमाची हाकीकत मावशीला किती सांगायचे याचा विचारत होती. गावी असलेले वडिलांनाही तिला सांगायचे होते.मयूरव उर्मिला  याबद्दल विचार करत होते. त्यावेळी त्यांना प्रश्न पडला की आपलं प्रेम होईल का?लग्नात दोन्ही घरची लोकं परवानगी देतील का? गावाकडची लोक काय म्हणतील? लग्न करण्यास कोण बाधा आणेल. असे नाना प्रकारचे प्रश्न सतत मनात घोळत होते. हे बाजू तिच्या मैत्रिणीना सांगत असताना. एका मैत्रिणीने तिला एस्ट्रोलॉजी कन्सल्टिंग असे सुचवले.त्यावेळी तीला मनोमय ज्योतिष केंद्र संचलित. ज्योतिष पंडित स्नेहा माने यांच्याकडे आली त्यांच्याकडून तिने वैयक्तिक मार्गदर्शन घेतले.समुपदेशन करताना तिने सुरुवातीला तिची सर्व हकीकत सांगितली. नुकतीच शेवटच्या वर्षाची परीक्षा दिली आहे. आई नसल्यामुळे मावशी कडे राहते मावशी सांभाळ करते. त्यामुळे मावशींनी तिच्या लग्नाची पूर्ण जबाबदारी उचलली होती. परंतु तिच्या मावशीच्या गावातील एक मयूर नावाचा तरुण आवडत होता. तोही एकटाच आई वडिलांचे छत्र हरवले होते. आजी आजोबा बरोबर राहत होता. शेती करत एका ठिकाणी नोकरी करत होता. त्यांचा असा प्रश्न होता की आमचे प्रेम आहे पण बाहेर सांगायला भीती वाटते घरातील लोकं कशी प्रतिक्रिया देतील. त्यांनी जर हे आमचे नाते नाकारले तर कसे होईल?दोघांच्या पत्रिका पाहिल्यावरअसे आढळून आले की मुलीच्या पत्रिकेमध्ये शुक्र हा बलवान स्थितीत होता. मी प्रेम विवाहाचे योग बोलके होते. त्याप्रमाणे पत्रिके वरून दोघांचे स्वभाव पाहिले. उर्मिला तशी स्थिर, धीमी, विचारी, मनाचा तोल जाऊन देणारी, शांतपणे काम करणारी, कोणत्याही बदलास व परिस्थितीस सामोरे जाणारी, वरून जरी ती प्रत्यक्ष रागिट वाटली तर मन प्रेमळ आहे. धाडसी पण थोडी अहंकारी आहे.नेहमी गुप्त राहणारी लपवणारी अशा स्वभावाचा असल्याने, आपल्या मनाचा थांगपत्ता लागू देत नाही. जरा काही मनाविरुद्ध झाले की लगेच राग व्यक्त करणे व स्पष्ट बोलक्या मनाची आहे. मयूरची ही पत्रिका पाहिली. चंचल ,प्रेमळ, दयाळू, प्रेमाचा भुकेला, संवेदनशील, नेहमी स्वप्नात रंगणारा, मनमोकळे आणि पारदर्शक आणि जेणेकरून जीवनात सुख व आनंद निर्माण करण्यात तरबेज होता. मोठ्या मनाचा, कुटुंबावर खूप प्रेम करायचा, त्याच्या आईवर ही खुप प्रेम करायचा. मित्र परिवारही मोठा होता. असा सात्विक, सदाचारी नेहमी दुसऱ्याच्या हिताचा विचार करणारा अशामुळे इकडे समाजशील, सहनशीलता होती.त्यांचा पुढचा प्रश्न होता की आमचा प्रेमविवाह योग आहे का?कुंडलीत असे दिसत होते की, समाजाचा विरोध असला तरी, मित्र जीवापाड मदत करत होती. मित्र-मैत्रिणीची मदत मिळेल. दोघांचेही लाभेश बलवान होते.गावातील बहुतेक व्यक्तींना समजले. मयूर च्या घरातील व्यक्तींनी सहमत दाखवली. उर्मिला च्या मावशी काकांनी यावर विचार केला. आणि तिच्या वडिलांना बोलावून यावर चर्चा केली. अखेरीस लग्नाला होकार मिळाला. आणि त्यांचा विवाह यशस्वी झाला. याचे कारण कुंडलीतील शुक्राची स्थिती उत्तम होती. परंतु जोडण्यासाठी राहू-केतू ची बाधा येत होती. त्या पद्धतीने राहू-केतू ची उपासना वाढवली. व मनापासून उपाय केले.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Rahu</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rahu-Ketu inauspiciousness</strong></p>
<p><strong>will reduce the intensity of saturn</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We always analyze the planetary zodiac changes and their effects from time to time. Accordingly, we are studying two planets J Rahu and Ketu which will change in the coming April month on 12th April. Rahu will enter Aries from Taurus and Ketu will enter Libra from Scorpio. What effect will they actually have? We are studying it according to the zodiac. What will be the effect of this change on Libra today? We will understand this in detail. #rahuketuparivartan</strong></p>
<p><strong>To understand the importance of Rahu and Ketu&#8217;s change of zodiac, we have to first understand the information of these two planets. Suppose Venus is a planet along with Rahu in a native&#8217;s journal, then it will work to create ownership in the mind of the native. How should my partner be? How smart must that be? Should he be tactful or should he talk to others or not? The planet representing all these things is Rahu. Ketu has opposite mindset. This will work even if the spouse is pregnant. It will work no matter what. A person with no color combination can also love someone. Because in the caste of such castes there is a combination of Ketu and Venus. The special thing is that the world of such castes is also very good. Because Ketu does not care about these things.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although the planets Rahu and Ketu are related to each other, they are both at different ends. Therefore, their effect is also opposite to each other. We can call Rahu the misery of Kaal. This is a shadow planet. He has a tendency to take revenge. It is also believed to be the cause of alcoholism and other bad habits. Accidents, theft, accidents, dacoity, displacement are all considered factors. But this does not completely spoil Rahu. He has some good stuff too. Rahu means to achieve something by working hard. Rahu means getting something quickly, enjoying material pleasures to the fullest. Therefore, in today&#8217;s 21st century, Rahu is of great importance in today&#8217;s modern era.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The planet Ketu has the opposite effect. It is the planet of liberation. Ketu is doing the work of taking man on the path of spirituality. If Ketu is strong in the horoscope of a person, then that person gets away from all the temptations of life. He is different than all. The causative planet of spirituality is actually three. These three planets are Saturn, Jupiter and Ketu. But there is a fundamental difference between these three. That is, Shani Maharaj tells the caste to behave with morality, justice and go towards salvation. Guru Maharaj tells Jataka that first complete all the actions, all the obligations and move towards salvation. So Ketu tells Jataka to renounce everything and move towards salvation. Of course Ketu is a planet that somewhere denies responsibility, we can say. Its effects are terrifying. Where he sits in the magazine, he works to create distance in the relationship. He is trying to destroy the causality of the planet he is sitting with. It also makes a distinction between the position in which it is sighted. Man gets bored because of the planet Ketu. So Rahu and Ketu&#8217;s zodiac sign is happening on 12th April. Rahu will enter Taurus from Aries and Ketu will enter Libra from Scorpio. What will be the effect of this change on Libra? Let us understand it now. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Looking at Libra, the arrival of Rahu will be in your seventh place. Also Ketu will arrive in your zodiac. Because these two planets change zodiac at the same time. Both start their journey at 180 degrees from each other and with rotational motion. Actually, these two planets are not points and their journey starts from a curved path. The impact of this visit is huge. Because both these planets are sitting firmly in the same zodiac for one and a half years. That is, Rahu and Ketu are the longest-lasting planets after Saturn in a zodiac. So this Rahu is in your seventh and Ketu is in your zodiac. They are showing a different kind of struggle in your life. I will also tell you the results of this struggle. However, Tul caste people should not be afraid of this. Because during this time Shani Maharaj is going to help you a lot. Therefore it is necessary to consider not only the fruits of Rahu-Ketu but also the auspicious results of Shani Maharaj or even Guru Maharaj. We will tell you that separately according to the amount.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Looking at the effect of Rahu, Rahu situated in the seventh house works to increase the ego of the partner somewhere. Takes your partner away from you or creates hatred between the two. At the same time, he loses family health. disturbs the peace of the family. So you have to take proper care of it. The world has said that a vessel must contain a vessel. However, it will be very important for you to take care that no controversy should arise. As you know Rahu has total three aspects: fifth, seventh and ninth. That is, he is seated at one place and his vision falling at three places is affected by the position of Rahu at four places. Accordingly, the fifth aspect of Rahu in the seventh position will move to the eleventh position. The eleventh place in the magazine is known as the place of profit and fulfillment of desires. After that the seventh sight will fall on your zodiac sign which is the first place and the ninth sight will fall on the third place which means strength and hard work. From the point of view of Rahu, being in the position of wish fulfillment from the seventh house, Rahu acts to not let your wishes come true or give everything other than what you want. Because their role is mainly in the case of non-fulfillment of their wishes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sight falling on Rahu&#8217;s zodiac will increase anger in your mind. At the same time, frustration can also increase. Because Ketu is also sitting there. The planet Ketu is the cause of depression. Your role will be to ignore a question or remain silent on something. You will have to face a lot of difficulties for this role. Because when we are constantly persecuted, wronged, harassed or harassed by our relatives, we are constantly thinking in our mind. In fact, it&#8217;s completely out of mind. Then somewhere its efficiency decreases. This could happen to you. Because in the week, the sight of Rahu will also fall at the place of your labor. From there he will work to remove your shortcomings. But even if all this is true, then the most important thing is that on April 29, Shani Maharaj will change your zodiac and enter your fifth place. From there his third vision will fall on Rahu. Saturn and Rahu are friendly planets. Also, Shani Maharaj is the Raja Yogakaraka planet of your magazine. Therefore Shani Maharaj will work to reduce the intensity of all the ill effects of Rahu that I have just told you. So it won&#8217;t bother you much. #bestastrologerinmaharashtra</strong></p>
<p><strong>In case of Ketu change, the coming of Ketu in your zodiac will work to change your thinking. This will constantly fill your mind with negative thoughts. All the bad things that are happening in the world are happening with me, this feeling will be formed in your mind. Whenever this feeling arises in your mind, I am giving you a suggestion that you should remember the dialogue between Karna and Lord Krishna at such a time. Which I also mentioned in some videos at that time. In this, Karna says, &#8220;Why all this happened to me? I was born and abandoned by my mother. what&#8217;s wrong with me? With this he presented all the miseries of life in front of Lord Krishna. Then Lord Krishna says to him, &#8220;You are telling this to a person who was planned to kill before birth. He was taken away from his mother as soon as he was born.&#8221; This is how Lord Krishna tries to calm his mind by telling him everything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accordingly, &#8216;Why in my case?&#8217; When you say so, you really have no right to say it. Because at that time many other auspicious works were done only in your case. Therefore Tul castes are specially advised to control their mind. Ketu coming to the zodiac and marriage place will try to take you away from you. Will try to create disappointment in the mind. In such an adverse situation, you have to overcome all these things of your own free will and move towards progress.
